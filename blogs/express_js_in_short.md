# Introduction
Express.js is a popular and powerful framework for building web applications with Node.js. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for handling HTTP requests and responses, routing, middleware, and more. In this post, we will explore some of the key features of Express.js and provide examples of how to use them.

## Installing Express.js
To get started with Express.js, we need to install it using Node Package Manager (npm). We can do this by running the following command in our terminal:
```
npm install express

```
### Routing
Routing is the process of mapping a URL to a particular piece of functionality in the application. In Express.js, we can define routes using the `app.get(), app.post(), app.put(), and app.delete()` methods. Here's an example of how to define a route for the root URL ("/"):

```javascript

const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```

In this example, we define a route for the root URL using the `app.get()` method. When a user visits the root URL, the server responds with the string "Hello, World!". We use the res.send() method to send the response back to the client.

We can also define routes with parameters. For example, suppose we want to define a route for a user profile page with a dynamic user ID parameter. We can define this route as follows:

```javascript

app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  res.send(`User profile for user with ID ${id}`);
});
```
In this example, we define a route for `"/users/:id"` where `":id"` is a parameter that can take on any value. When a user visits this URL (e.g. `"/users/123"`), the server responds with a personalized message that includes the ID of the user.

### Middleware
Middleware is a function that sits between the request and the response and can modify or manipulate both. Express.js provides a wide variety of middleware that can be used for tasks like parsing request bodies, handling cookies, serving static files, and more.

Here's an example of how to use middleware to log incoming requests:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`Received ${req.method} request for ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, World!');
});
```
In this example, we define a middleware function that logs incoming requests to the console. We use the `app.use()` method to mount this middleware to the app. When a user visits the root URL, the server responds with the string "Hello, World!" as before.

We can also use middleware to parse request bodies. For example, suppose we have a form on our website that allows users to submit their email address. We can define a route that handles this form submission as follows:

```javascript
app.post('/submit-email', express.urlencoded({ extended: true }), (req, res) => {
  const email = req.body.email;
  res.send(`Thank you for submitting your email address: ${email}`);
});
```
In this example, we use the `express.urlencoded()` middleware to parse the request body, which contains the email address submitted by the user. We then use this email address to generate a personalized response message.
